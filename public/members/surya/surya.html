            <p>
                I was always fascinated by science and engineering and about how things work since I could remember. 
                I first saw linux when I was in 7th grade when my father got it. I didn't like it that much back then since it involved
                running commads and I wasn't able to play roblox on it and i was forced to resort to Linux Tux racing &#128514. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My interest in computers grew as I learnt programming languages like C++ and python.
                First fully started linux after I joined college. I started with Linux Mint, used Fedora workstation for a while and 
                now currently am on Arch with GNOME and hyprland desktop enviroment.
                I am more interested in hardwares like microcontrollers and low level programming.
